bayesianchangepoint
===================

An implementation of [Adams &amp; MacKay 2007 "Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection"](http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.3742)
in Python.  As well as the Adams & MacKay paper, 
I also used Ryan Adam's beautifully commented 
[MATLAB implementation](http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/rpa23/changepoint.php) 
of their changepoint detection algorithm.
